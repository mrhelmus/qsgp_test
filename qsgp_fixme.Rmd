##QSGP Examples
QSGP is the *most* awesome class! I have learned so much! Below I show off some of the things I have learned! 

```{r setup, include = TRUE, echo = FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(nycflights13)
library(knitr)
```

###First, let's do some joining on the flights data

```{r make the objects}

flights2 <- flights %>% 
  select(year, origin, dest, tailnum, carrier, distance)


flights2 <- flights2 %>%
  select(-origin, -dest) %>% 
  left_join(airlines, by = "carrier")
kable(flights2[1:10,])

```

Now make a histogram for <font color="blue">JetBlue</font>

```{r JetBlue Histogram}

flights2 %>% filter(carrier == "B6") %>% ggplot(mapping = aes(x = distance)) + geom_histogram() + ylab("JetBlue Distance count")

flights %>% 
  group_by(carrier) %>%
  summarise(count = n())
```

Drop the mic! Off to save the world...
